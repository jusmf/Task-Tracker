# Task Tracker

## Overview

Use this application to keep track of daily tasks. Users are able to create new taks, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, and set them as complete or active. This application also has a built-in filtering feature that allows users to view all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks based on their status. Give it a try!<br /><br />

## Who is this application for?

Anyone who wants to organize their daily tasks in one place and organize tasks based on whether they're active or completed.<br /><br />

## How do I get started?

Download the source code and run npm install then run npm start. The application should be available at your localhost:3000<br /><br /> 

## How Could This App be Improved?

In a further iteration of this application I would like to add drag and drop functionality to allow users to organize similar tasks. It would also be nice for users to be able to list each task as high, medium, or low priority. From a developer standpoint, implementing testing would be a surefire way to ensure the application is running as expected and catch bugs more efficiently.<br /><br />
